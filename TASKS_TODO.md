BUGS:

NEXT UPDATE:


POST V1 or NOT FULLY DECIDED:
- [ ] Party commands by word and by letter — RESEARCHED, ready to build (see docs/party-commands-research.md)
    Leaders of the player's clan parties take orders through conversation or letters via a
    `set_party_course` native tool (v1 verbs: patrol / escort_player / go_to / hold / resume) —
    and being persons, may negotiate or refuse; a mailed order takes effect when the courier arrives
    (compose/reply already ride CompleteSpokenAsync with tools — zero extra plumbing).
    The verified-on-v1.4.7 technique: do NOT fight the AI with SetMoveX/DoNotMakeNewDecisions —
    inject the order into the party's own hourly deliberation (`CampaignEvents.AiHourlyTickEvent`
    → `PartyThinkParams.AddBehaviorScore` with `AIBehaviorData`, score 15f wins; `AiBehavior` enum
    is in TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem.Party; naval routing free via Helpers.AiHelper). No Harmony
    needed. Orders persist as plain strings in SyncData (no new saveable classes); they clear
    honestly on army-join/capture/party-death/target-turned-enemy/unreachable, and EVERY
    set/change/lapse fires a colored InformationManager.DisplayMessage — the left-side line AND
    the permanent event-log entry Anton asked for. Cut from v1: raid, besiege, disband, caravans,
    other lords. Reference source (MIT, supports exactly v1.4.0–1.4.7, studied 2026.07.15):
    ..\reference\Bannerlord.PartyAI; prior art: Finer Party Controls (closed, clan-screen panel +
    the "Thinks" framework that exists precisely because naive SetMove is unstable).
- [ ] NPCs that are in charge of Cities/Castles when they see ana enemy army they get the army and their party/castle info and get the option to send a letter (asking for help, letting the player know they can hold etc)
- [ ] Utility model split (cost saving)
    a UtilityModel per backend (gpt-5.6-luna / claude-haiku-4-5) for the small calls — feeling number,
    desire yes/no, search refining — cuts roughly a third of cost; parked until the ledger's real
    numbers say it's worth the second client (see docs/models-and-costs.md).
- [ ] Localization wiring
    V1 ships English-only UI and says so on the page; the {=ImmersiveAI_*} ids exist if we ever wire
    the XML. (The NPCs already answer in whatever language the player writes — stated proudly on the page.)
- [ ] "Send letter" in hero's encyclopedia
    Milestone 2 GUI, letters chapter, the remaining half: a "Send letter" button on the encyclopedia hero page — needs swapping `EncyclopediaHeroPageVM` for a subclass (patch the page-VM factory) + overriding the big hero-page prefab to add the button; simplest wiring now is the button opening the letter window (2026.07.10) preselected on that hero. The letter-writing screen half is DONE — the letter window's composer (correspondence alongside, draft mirror, "Seal and send") covers it.
- [ ] Actions for the NPCs:
    NPCs that can ACT, not just know (found while mining ChatAi for the "what the NPC can interact with" task, 2026.07.10): ChatAi lets the LLM trigger real game actions via its NpcDecisionPlanner/AIActionEvaluator — travel to a settlement, patrol, join the player's party (or offer to for coin), accept a join offer, marry the player, give the player gold, start a spar/fight. The info half is done (recall_company + situation whispers); the acting half deserves its own design pass — likely the same native tool-call channel (an "act" tool family beside the recalls), each action gated and phrased to the NPC as a choice of their own will, never a command. Decide scope with Anton first: which actions, what limits, how consent/impossibility is narrated back.
- [ ] Reply language option (from ChatAi comment mining, 2026.07.17 — the single most repeated ask over there: Polish, Korean, Russian, Turkish, French, Spanish...)
    A `ReplyLanguage` config key (+ MCM text field) that, when set, injects one gentle line into every
    sheet — "Answer always in X, whatever tongue is spoken to you" — so NPCs hold their language even
    when the player types English UI terms or mixed text. Today NPCs already mirror whatever language
    the player writes (stated on the page); this makes it a firm, discoverable setting instead of an
    emergent behavior. Near-zero cost, one line through PromptBuilder; distinct from the UI
    localization task above (this is the NPCs' tongue, not the mod's strings).
- [ ] Quest-taken Angel note (from ChatAi comment mining, 2026.07.17)
    ChatAi players complained NPCs are confused when a quest is accepted via VANILLA dialogue and then
    discussed in chat — the LLM never saw the acceptance. We already cover most of it (TroubleBuilder
    narrates issue state incl. taken-by-player; silent meeting beats record that a talk happened), but
    a silent Angel note on the GIVER's memory the day their quest is taken — "This day you gave X your
    trouble to carry: <quest title>" — closes it fully and makes the memory itself carry the moment,
    not just the situation sheet. Same pattern as MeetingLine (CampaignEvents quest-started hook, no
    LLM call, one per quest, dedupe like IsMeetingLine).
- [ ] Steam page: FAQ + cost plain-talk + local-model note (from ChatAi comment mining, 2026.07.17)
    ChatAi's comments are dominated by (a) "is this free/safe? API = virus?" fear, (b) "does it work
    with X mod / War Sails / Linux?" questions, (c) local-model setup confusion. Add to our page:
    a short FAQ (compat: Diplomacy/Dramalord/Marry Anyone/overhauls; War Sails yes; Steam Deck/Proton
    note after one test); one plain sentence of what a typical hour costs in cents on the default
    models and that the key goes ONLY to the provider you chose; and a "local models: what to expect"
    note (the Local backend → LM Studio/Ollama works, but small models are shaky with our eleven tools —
    point at RelationshipChangesViaTool:false as the fallback). Cheap words, preempts the loudest
    complaint threads on the competitor's page.
- [ ] Voice-over via OpenRouter audio (POST V1 — researched 2026.07.17, see memory chatai-comments-and-voice-backends)
    NPCs speaking their replies aloud. Backend: OpenRouter's dedicated OpenAI-compatible endpoints —
    `/api/v1/audio/speech` (TTS) and `/api/v1/audio/transcriptions` (STT) — the SAME sk-or- key the
    mod already carries; models incl. Kokoro 82M (very cheap, 54 preset voices — enough to assign a
    stable per-NPC voice from StringId like the speech styles) and gpt-4o-mini-tts / Gemini Flash TTS.
    OpenAI backend works too (tts-1 $15/1M chars); Anthropic has no audio API. Request PCM/WAV output
    so .NET 4.7.2 playback stays simple (System.Media.SoundPlayer handles WAV — no mp3 decoder).
    Rails: OPTIONAL and default OFF, its own toggle + voice/model config, every synthesis billed
    through UsageLedger with its own price line (ChatAi's users report TTS eats ~10x the text credits —
    the cost story must stay boringly honest), fail-soft (a dead audio call never blocks the spoken
    text), and off-thread synthesis marshaled like every other LLM call. STT (player speaking) is a
    separate later step — TTS first.
- [ ] NPC to NPC chat
    In the future have a system that lets the NPC pick a person (another NPC) to talk to and for them to be able to exchange a few messages and for me to be able to see the log or watch them in real time talk, again maybe based on how popular they are, but even the unused to have the option to do it. So they should have a general deep memory, a per person deep memory and per person hist maybe
