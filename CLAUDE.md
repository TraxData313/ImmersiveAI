# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

**Immersive AI** — a mod for *Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord* that makes NPCs converse
through an LLM with persistent, layered memory and distinct personalities. It is a
**clean-room rewrite** inspired by the closed-source "ChatAi" Workshop mod (studied via
decompilation only — no code was copied, so this is freely publishable).

The two problems it exists to fix, in priority order:
1. **Repetitive NPCs.** ChatAi stuffs a huge static context into one prompt with a single
   generic system message shared by every NPC. Immersive AI instead gives each NPC a real
   multi-turn conversation, a rolling summary of older exchanges, durable "known facts",
   and a distinct speech style.
2. **Poor chat UI.** ChatAi reuses the vanilla text popup. A custom Gauntlet window is
   planned (Milestone 2); today the reply is shown in the native conversation panel.

## Who does what

The user (Anton) is an AI engineer acting as **product owner / manager** — he directs
priorities and playtests. Claude is the **developer** — designs and writes the code. Anton
has not built mods before, so explain Bannerlord-specific mechanics when they come up.

## Repository layout

```
src/ImmersiveAI.Core/     netstandard2.0 — game-independent logic, fully unit-tested
  Llm/                    IChatClient abstraction + ChatMessage (no HTTP, no game deps)
  Memory/                 NpcMemory (3-layer), ConversationTurn, JsonMemoryStore, MemoryCompressor
  Prompts/                PromptBuilder (multi-turn message assembly), NpcPersona
src/ImmersiveAI.Module/   net472 — the Bannerlord module; references game DLLs
  SubModule.cs            entry point: registers behavior, drains dispatcher each tick
  ImmersiveChatBehavior.cs  the campaign behavior: dialog + conversation turn orchestration
  Llm/                    AnthropicChatClient, OpenAIChatClient (raw HttpClient), factory
  Personas/PersonaBuilder.cs  builds NpcPersona from live Hero data + assigned speech style
  PromptFiles.cs          loads user-editable global/per-NPC prompt files
  ModConfig.cs            JSON config (API keys, model, token/memory limits)
  MainThreadDispatcher.cs marshals async LLM results back to the game thread
tests/ImmersiveAI.Core.Tests/  xUnit tests for Core (net8.0)
module/SubModule.xml      Bannerlord module manifest (module ID: ImmersiveAI)
tools/deploy.ps1          build + install into the game's Modules folder
Directory.Build.props     shared MSBuild props; GameFolder points at the Bannerlord install
```

The decompiled ChatAi reference is **outside this repo** at
`C:\Users\Trax\Documents\BannerlordMods\reference\ChatAi-decompiled` — consult it for
TaleWorlds API usage patterns, never copy from it.

## Architecture rules

- **Core stays pure.** No `TaleWorlds.*`, no `System.Net.Http`, no game or HTTP dependencies
  in `ImmersiveAI.Core`. That is what keeps it unit-testable. LLM backends and game glue
  live in `ImmersiveAI.Module` behind the `IChatClient` interface.
- **Memory is three layers** (`NpcMemory`): `RecentTurns` (verbatim, sent as real
  user/assistant messages), `Summary` (rolling, LLM-compressed when turns exceed
  `MaxRecentTurns`), and `KnownFacts` (distilled one-liners). This is the anti-repetition core.
- **Every NPC gets a distinct voice.** `PersonaBuilder` deterministically assigns a speech
  style from `Hero.StringId` so it's stable across sessions, plus personality from real
  traits. Distinct voices + relevant-only context are the levers against repetition.
- **Anthropic is the default backend**, model `claude-opus-4-8`. Clients use raw `HttpClient`
  because the official SDK needs modern .NET and the game runs mods on .NET Framework 4.7.2.
- **Async LLM calls never touch UI directly.** Background results are queued via
  `MainThreadDispatcher.Enqueue` and drained on `SubModule.OnApplicationTick`.

## Build, test, deploy

Requires the .NET 8 SDK and a Bannerlord install (path in `Directory.Build.props`, override
in `Directory.Build.props.user` if it differs). The game must be closed (or at the main menu)
when deploying, or the DLL is locked.

```powershell
dotnet build -c Release                       # build everything
dotnet test  -c Release                        # run Core unit tests (must stay green)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\deploy.ps1   # build + install into the game
```

`deploy.ps1` compiles the module and copies `SubModule.xml` + the DLLs into
`<GameFolder>\Modules\ImmersiveAI\bin\Win64_Shipping_Client\`. After deploying, enable
"Immersive AI" in the Bannerlord launcher.

**Always run `dotnet test` after changing Core.** Game-integration code can't be unit-tested,
so it is verified by the user playtesting; write Core logic to be testable and keep coverage.

## User-editable runtime files (NOT in the repo)

Created on first run under `Documents\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\Configs\ImmersiveAI\`:
- `config.json` — API keys, `Backend` ("Anthropic"/"OpenAI"), model, `MaxTokens`, memory limits.
- `global_prompt.txt` — world-wide instructions added to every NPC (lines starting with
  `#` or `//` are ignored, matching ChatAi's convention).
- `NPCs\<stringId>_<FirstName>\` — one folder per NPC (e.g. `NPCs\lord_7_13_1_Gunjadrid\`).
  The folder name embeds the first name for readability; identity is still the stringId. Holds:
  - `memories.json` — persisted NpcMemory for that NPC.
  - `custom_instructions.txt` — per-NPC prompt (comment lines `#`/`//` ignored).
  - future per-NPC files go here too.
- `NPCs\_README.txt` — auto-written blurb explaining the layout to the user.

The folder layout, path resolution, and the one-time migration from the old flat
`memory\<id>.json` / `npcs\<id>.txt` files are owned by `src\ImmersiveAI.Module\NpcPaths.cs`.
**If you change the layout or file names, update `NpcPaths` (including its `RuntimeReadmeText`
and the migration in `EnsureMigrated`) and these runtime-files sections in README.md /
CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md together.**

## In-game feature (current)

Talking to any hero shows a **"Speak freely with me. [Immersive AI]"** dialog option →
"Say something..." → a text popup → the reply appears in the conversation panel and loops.
Errors surface as a top-left "Immersive AI: ..." message.

Known caveat: the "considers your words..." → reply transition can outrun a slow LLM call and
briefly show "..."; clicking again shows the reply. The custom UI in Milestone 2 removes this.

## Work flow for the TASKs
- Get the taks you work on from TASKS_TODO.md
- When dove move it to the end of TASKS_DONE.md, rename it if it changed or is badly formatted and add a done ts at the end (YYYY.MM.DD HH.MM.SS)
- When done with changed and tested them, recompile so the mod is rebuild automaticaly in C:\Users\Trax\Documents\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\Configs\ImmersiveAI - dont ask the user to rebuild

## Conventions

- Match the surrounding code style; keep comments about *constraints/intent*, not narration.
- End git commit messages with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- The user commits from GitHub Desktop too — write descriptive commit messages, expect a
  shared history. Closing VS Code / Explorer windows on the repo may be needed before folder
  renames on Windows.
- `<GameFolder>` currently: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord`.
